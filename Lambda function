 
Ex for a calculator button, each button has its own function
x = lambda b:b
print(x(4))

  
def fun (a,b)
 return a+b
 
x=fun(3,4)
print(x)

Instead of that we can use:

Ex2
x = lambda a,b:a+b
print(x(3,4))

Ex1
x = lambda a:a*10
print(x(4))


Ex for a calculator button, each button has its own function
x = lambda b:b
print(x(4))

x = lambda a,b,c : a+b+c
print(x(5,6,2))


Main use when we need to define function within function:

def myfunc(n)
 return lambda a: a * n
 
tripler = myfunc(3)
print(tripler)

doubler = myfunc(2)
print(doubler)
